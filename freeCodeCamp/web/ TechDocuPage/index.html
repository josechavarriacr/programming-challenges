            JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language. It is designed for creating network-centric applications. It is complimentary to and integrated with Java. JavaScript is very easy to implement because it is integrated with HTML. It is open and cross-platform.
          </p>
          <p>Javascript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web pages, whose implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages. It is an interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities.</p>
          <p>
            JavaScript was first known as LiveScript, but Netscape changed its name to JavaScript, possibly because of the excitement being generated by Java. JavaScript made its first appearance in Netscape 2.0 in 1995 with the name LiveScript. The general-purpose core of the language has been embedded in Netscape, Internet Explorer, and other web browsers.
          </p>
          <li>Client-side JavaScript is the most common form of the language. The script should be included in or referenced by an HTML document for the code to be interpreted by the browser.</li>
          <li>
            It means that a web page need not be a static HTML, but can include programs that interact with the user, control the browser, and dynamically create HTML content.

            The JavaScript client-side mechanism provides many advantages over traditional CGI server-side scripts. For example, you might use JavaScript to check if the user has entered a valid e-mail address in a form field.

            JavaScript can be implemented using JavaScript statements that are placed within the script tags
          </p>
          <p>
            You can place the "script" tags, containing your JavaScript, anywhere within your web page, but it is normally recommended that you should keep it within the "head" tags.

            The "script" tag alerts the browser program to start interpreting all the text between these tags as a script. A simple syntax of your JavaScript will appear as follows.
          </p>
          <code>
            function greetMe(yourName) {
              alert('Hello ' + yourName);
            }
            console.log(eval('3 + 5'));
          </code>
          Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!

          <p>All the modern browsers come with built-in support for JavaScript. Frequently, you may need to enable or disable this support manually. This chapter explains the procedure of enabling and disabling JavaScript support in your browsers: Internet Explorer, Firefox, chrome, and Opera.</p>
          <li>
            Here are simple steps to turn on or turn off JavaScript in your Internet Explorer −

            Follow Tools → Internet Options from the menu.

            Select Security tab from the dialog box.

            Click the Custom Level button.

            Scroll down till you find Scripting option.

            Select Enable radio button under Active scripting.

            Finally click OK and come out
          </li>
          <li>
            Here are the steps to turn on or turn off JavaScript in Firefox −

            Open a new tab → type about: config in the address bar.

            Then you will find the warning dialog. Select I’ll be careful, I promise!

            Then you will find the list of configure options in the browser.

            In the search bar, type javascript.enabled.

            There you will find the option to enable or disable javascript by right-clicking on the value of that option → select toggle.

            If javascript.enabled is true; it converts to false upon clicking toogle. If javascript is disabled; it gets enabled upon clicking toggle.
          </li>
          <li>
            Here are the steps to turn on or turn off JavaScript in Chrome −

            Click the Chrome menu at the top right hand corner of your browser.

            Select Settings.

            Click Show advanced settings at the end of the page.

            Under the Privacy section, click the Content settings button.

            In the "Javascript" section, select "Do not allow any site to run JavaScript" or "Allow all sites to run JavaScript (recommended)".

          <p>One of the most fundamental characteristics of a programming language is the set of data types it supports. These are the type of values that can be represented and manipulated in a programming language.

            JavaScript allows you to work with three primitive data types</p>
            <li>Numbers, eg. 123, 120.50 etc.</li>
            <li>Strings of text e.g. "This text string" et</li>
            <li>Boolean e.g. true or false.</li>
            <p>Like many other programming languages, JavaScript has variables. Variables can be thought of as named containers. You can place data into these containers and then refer to the data simply by naming the container.

              Before you use a variable in a JavaScript program, you must declare it. Variables are declared with the var keyword as follows.</p>
              <code>
                var money;
                var name;
              </code>
              <p>You can also declare multiple variables with the same var keyword as follows </p>
              <code>
                var money, name;
                var name = "Ali";
                var money;
                money = 2000.50;
              </code>
              <p>The scope of a variable is the region of your program in which it is defined. JavaScript variables have only two scopes.</p>
              <li>Global Variables − A global variable has global scope which means it can be defined anywhere in your JavaScript code.</li>
              <li>
                Local Variables − A local variable will be visible only within a function where it is defined. Function parameters are always local to that function.
              </li>

              <p>While writing a program, there may be a situation when you need to adopt one out of a given set of paths. In such cases, you need to use conditional statements that allow your program to make correct decisions and perform right actions.

                JavaScript supports conditional statements which are used to perform different actions based on different conditions. Here we will explain the if..else statement.</p>
                <li>
                  The if statement is the fundamental control statement that allows JavaScript to make decisions and execute statements conditionally.
                </li>
                <code>
                  if (expression){
                    Statement(s) to be executed if expression is true}
                  </code>
                  <li>The 'if...else' statement is the next form of control statement that allows JavaScript to execute statements in a more controlled way.</li>
                  <code>
                    if (expression){
                      Statement(s) to be executed if expression is true
                    }
                    else{
                      Statement(s) to be executed if expression is false
                    }
                  </code>

                  <p>A function is a group of reusable code which can be called anywhere in your program. This eliminates the need of writing the same code again and again. It helps programmers in writing modular codes. Functions allow a programmer to divide a big program into a number of small and manageable functions.

                    Like any other advanced programming language, JavaScript also supports all the features necessary to write modular code using functions</p>
                    <li>Before we use a function, we need to define it. The most common way to define a function in JavaScript is by using the function keyword, followed by a unique function name, a list of parameters (that might be empty), and a statement block surrounded by curly braces.</li>
                    <code>
                      function functionname(parameter-list)
                      {
                        statements
                      }
                    </code>
                    <li>We have modified our sayHello function here. Now it takes two parameters.</li>
                    <code>
                      function sayHello(name, age)
                      {
                        document.write (name + " is " + age + " years old.");
                      }
                    </code>
